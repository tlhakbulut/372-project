Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nIn a bowl, mix together the soy sauce and ground ginger. Place the brown sugar into a shallow bowl. Spread open a pitted date, then stuff it with a smoked almond. Wrap the date with half a bacon slice, secure it with a toothpick, dip the bundle in soy sauce mixture, and then dip it into brown sugar. Place the wrapped dates into the prepared baking dish. If desired, sprinkle a little more brown sugar over the bundles.\nBake in the preheated oven until the bacon is brown and crisp, 15 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes before serving;serve warm or at room temperature.',627),(618,'In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the eggs sugar and dates. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and boil for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Mix in crispy rice cereal. Butter hands and roll the mixture into walnut sized balls. Roll the balls in coconut. Serve.',628),(619,'Mix semolina flour, all-purpose flour, mahlab, and salt together in a large bowl. Work clarified butter into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until thoroughly incorporated. Cover bowl and let dough rest at room temperature, 8 hours to overnight.\nPour milk into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until just warm, about 15 seconds. Stir in sugar and yeast until dissolved. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.\nPour yeast mixture and orange blossom water over the dough and mix until evenly moistened. Pinch off a piece of dough and roll into a ball;it should hold its shape without cracking. Add more milk or orange blossom water if needed. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\nSprinkle some flour over the maamoul molds and tap out the excess. Pinch off a walnut-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball. Press your thumb into the ball to create space for the filling. Work the edges with your fingers so the sides are even and fairly thin. Drop in a piece of date paste and pinch dough over it to seal.\nPlace cookie into the mold cavity seam-side up. Press down so that the top is flush with edges of the mold. Trim off any excess dough. Invert the mold and tap it against your work surface to release the cookie. Repeat with remaining dough and date paste, arranging cookies 1 inch apart on the baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven, 1 baking sheet at a time, until edges and bottoms are golden but tops are still mostly pale, about 15 minutes.\nSift powdered sugar over the cookies while still slightly warm. Let cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.',629),(620,'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nCombine the dates, pecans, water, banana, egg, butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to the date mixture and stir until well combined.\nDrop dough by tablespoonfuls about 1 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheet and flatten lightly with the palm of your hand.\nBake in the preheated oven until cookies start to brown around the edges, being careful not to over-bake, for 11 to 13 minutes. Transfer cookies immediately to a wire rack to cool.',630),(621,'Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\nIn a large bowl, combine dates, brown sugar, margarine and boiling water. Let stand 15 minutes. Stir in flour, soda and vanilla.
